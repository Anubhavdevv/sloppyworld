## About

> I’m Anubhav currently pursuing my bachelor’s in computer science and Technology. I’m an Open Source and Tech enthusiast I'm fascinated by technology and try to learn new things every day to broaden my horizons.

I want to gain some real-world software experience and I think open source is a great opporuntiy for enhance my skills and to work in an environment where I 
can learn something new and can contribute more to the company. I'm an AngelHack Student Ambassador and a Microsoft Student Learning Ambassador. I enjoy being a part of communities and enjoy interacting with people from all walks of life. My goal is to raise awareness of forthcoming technologies that will have a profound impact on the industry.
